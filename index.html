                Between work, keeping on top of your personal life, and squeezing in a couple loads of laundry, eating
                healthy can be tough. After a long day, you just want a filling meal that takes minutes to make. We get it. That's why we've compiled quick and healthy meal recipes that will help you feel good inside and
                out.

                    You wouldn't think anything creamy would be considered healthy, but feast your eyes on this beaut.
                    And
                    in case you're wondering, this chicken is seasoned with some bacon.

                <h3>Blackened <span class="orange-color">Chicken</span> and Avocado Salad</h3>
                <p>
                    This low-carb, gluten-free healthy recipe will have you hoarding avocados. Savor this well-seasoned

                    spaghetti squash, and you've got a fancy (and cheap) date night ahead of you.
